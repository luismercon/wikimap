This project was developed within the scope of the Environmental Intelligence discipline, in the master's course at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra - ISEC.

- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Expo CLI
- A simulator/emulator (Xcode for iOS or Android Studio for Android) or a physical device
